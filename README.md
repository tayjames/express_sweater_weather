# Sweater Weather Express
Sweater Weather Express is a project that allows users to register, login, and retrieve a forecase for a location using API calls and responses.

## Learning Goals
* Utilize a project board to create and track details for project completion
* Practice written technical communication with concise and consistent git commits and clear pull requests
* Clearly document Introduction, Initial Setup, How to Use, Known Issues, Running Tests, How to Contribute, Core Contributors, Schema Design, and Tech Stack List
* Implement testing in JavaScript
* Familiarize self with mechanics of building an Express API

# Setup
### Requirements
* Node 10.16.3
* dotenv: using this package will ensure the security of sesitive environment variables
* bcrypt: using this package will allow for password management; be sure to create a `.env` file to store API keys
* jest: using this pachage will allow for a testing suit

### Configuration
* Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
* cd into express_sweater_weather directory and run `npm install` from your command line.
* Setup your database by running `npx sequelize db:create` and `npx sequelize db:migrate`
* You will need two API keys to get the forecast for a location:
  * GOOGLE_GEOCODE_API_KEY: (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start "Get started here")
  * DARK_SKY_API_KEY: (https://darksky.net/dev "Get started here")
